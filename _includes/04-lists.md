I love playing sports. Apparently, Boston Celtics is my favorite NBA team. Binge-watching TV series from time to time is a hobby of mine.
I have a tendency to write as well. Learning and grasping from the stimulus around me is something that I cherish and would consider it to be the most favorite thing I possess.
